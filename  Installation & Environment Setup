   Installation

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation

- ROS has various Distributions
- Recommended are the ones that have LTS(Long Time Support) such as Indigo, Kinetic & Melodic
- These distributions can be installed on platforms like Ubuntu, Debian, MacOS, etc. but the Distributions works on specific version of the Platform.
  ex. Kinetic works on Ubuntu 15.10 and 16.04

- Its recommended to install a Ubuntu virtual-machine rather than have a Ubuntu OS in your physical machine, coz ROS can create issues that may require you to re-install the OS.
  ex. for a Windows machine you can install a VMware Workstation Pro and have a virtual machine. Its recommended to have a backup of your virtual machine.

   Environment Setup
------------------------------------------------------------
- After following the installation steps i.e from Debian package index update to installing all the dependencies.
- You need to source the setup.bash of the ROS workspace inorder to enable ROS.
- Inorder to do it permanently,

	$ gedit .bashrc //open your bashrc file from the ``home directory``
	// add the below line in the file so that you need not do source everytime you open a new terminal

	source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
	// you'll have to just do -> source .bashrc

	-- .bashrc is the file i.e. executed by default everytime we open a new terminal and is present in the `home` directory.

- Its necessary to have a workspace, that'll have packages to run ROS.
ex.
	//open terminal in home
	$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src //----src is the folder where you put your projects
	$ cd catkin_ws
	$ catkin_make //compile your workspace

	//to make a workspace as our default workspace, add the below line in the .bashrc file
	source /home/agv/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
